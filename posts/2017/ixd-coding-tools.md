At first, you're probably saying "coding tools for IxD? What in the world?". Well, in my job as an interaction designer for Red Hat, coding tools are just as important to me as Sketch or Balsamiq. Without these coding tools, I couldn't do half of the things that I need to do, and would not be able to contribute to the open source projects that I'm interested in. So, without further adieu, I present my list of 'daily drivers':

## Chrome / Safari

Yes, I know, not what some might consider a standard tool. But, for me, the ability to view any page in any way possible, as well as inspect elements that are in use in projects that I'm working on, is indispensable. Without Google Chrome, I wouldn't have the inspector tools and amazing plugins that that system affords it's users. Without Safari, I'd be missing out on clean user agent switching to other Apple devices that are key for testing where interfaces can be improved.

## Atom

An editor? As number 2? Yes - an editor - but not just any editor. As a product from GitHub, Atom allows me to easily connect to the repositories that I work with, sync with an amazing array of plugins and themes (sharing those configurations with others that I work with - which saves onboarding time) and view many files in a seemed preview mode. I know that other editors let you preview markdown, asciidoc or html without going to another screen, but Atom is the only one I've found that consistently does it well, using minimal resources and minimal refresh issues.

## Hyper (or iTerm) + fish

Ok, so now you probably think I'm truly messing with you, but I swear I'm not. Like Atom, I use a heavily customized Hyper environment, with the fish shell (friendly interactive shell) on top of it. Previously, as a full-time UI developer, and I came to prefer consoles to access system information, clone GitHub repositories and commit code. While many designers swear by SourceTree or GitHub Desktop, I've found that a fully thought of terminal environment can you you every bit of information that you could need, without having the look through app settings or hidden Windows. While it may take some time to learn the commands (hence why I have a customized shell - I just need to remember my shortcuts), it will always pay off in the long run. Imaging being able to see all of your system information, branch name, file status (changed - deleted vs added) and active folder all in one place, within seconds of each other. And the beauty is, if you don't like that, just customize it! It doesn't get much better than that, in my opinion.

So there you go - the coding tools that I, as an Interaction Designer, use on a daily basis. I know that there isn't much here, but I wanted to share this for anyone else who is looking for a good starting point on coding tools, especially if you haven't used one before.

Enjoy!
